The HALT framework is one of the most practical and elegant tools in emotional regulation work. Originally developed in the context of addiction recovery, it's been widely adapted for emotional eating, stress management, and general self-awareness.

HALT asks you to check four things before acting on an impulse:

**H** — Am I **Hungry**?
**A** — Am I **Angry** (or Anxious, Annoyed, Overwhelmed)?
**L** — Am I **Lonely** (or Disconnected, Missing connection)?
**T** — Am I **Tired** (or Depleted, Overstimulated, Exhausted)?

## Why These Four?

These four states are among the most common underlying drivers of emotional eating — and more broadly, of poor decision-making, emotional reactivity, and impulsive behavior.

**Hunger** is the obvious one, but it's often missed. After a day of distracted or restricted eating, genuine physical hunger can be driving evening eating patterns without the person recognizing it as hunger.

**Anger** (or its relatives: frustration, anxiety, overwhelm) is frequently a driver of stress eating. The aggression or activation that comes with these emotions seeks an outlet — and eating is one of the most socially acceptable ones.

**Loneliness** is deeply tied to food, particularly for people who eat alone or who have strong memories of food as connection. Loneliness and disconnection trigger a felt need for comfort, and food delivers comfort reliably.

**Tired** covers a wide range: physical exhaustion, mental depletion, emotional fatigue, and overstimulation. When we're tired, the prefrontal cortex goes offline and impulse control drops. We reach for easy relief — food.

## Using HALT in Practice

**The evening check-in**: Before dinner or before the evening snacking window begins, take 60 seconds to run through HALT. Which of these am I experiencing right now? Rate each 0-10 if helpful.

**The craving pause**: When you notice a craving, pause before acting and run through HALT. You're not trying to talk yourself out of eating — you're trying to understand what's driving the craving.

**The retrospective review**: After an episode of emotional eating, run HALT to understand what state you were in. This builds pattern recognition over time.

## What to Do With the Answer

**If hungry**: Eat. Give yourself permission to eat real food that satisfies you. The answer to hunger is food.

**If angry/anxious**: Can you address the source? Name the feeling? Process it physically (movement, breath)? Sometimes the feeling just needs to be witnessed, not fixed.

**If lonely**: Can you reach out — even briefly? Sometimes the awareness itself is enough. "I'm lonely right now" is valuable information.

**If tired**: Can you rest? Even 20 minutes of actual rest — lying down, eyes closed — can be transformative. If not, can you be gentle with yourself and lower the stakes for the evening?

## HALT as Part of the Mindful Evenings System

The Mindful Evenings check-in incorporates HALT concepts within a broader framework. We add two additional dimensions to help you understand what you actually need: what value is being unfulfilled (Rest, Connection, Accomplishment, Comfort, Play, Peace), and what response might genuinely address it.

HALT is the beginning of the question. The Mindful Evenings check-in helps you find the answer.
