Ozempic and other GLP-1 medications are remarkably effective at reducing appetite — during the day. But many people report that evening cravings persist or even intensify. If this is your experience, here's what's happening and what to do about it.

## The Specific Nature of GLP-1 and Evening Cravings

GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide reduce appetite primarily through:

1. Slowing gastric emptying
2. Reducing hunger signals in the hypothalamus
3. Increasing satiety hormone responses

However, evening cravings often have a *different* driver than daytime hunger. Evening cravings are frequently:

- **Emotionally driven**: Stress, boredom, loneliness, and anxiety tend to peak in the evening, and GLP-1s don't directly address emotional triggers for eating.
- **Habitual**: Deeply ingrained eating habits (the "evening snack while watching TV" routine) have neural pathways that medication doesn't easily interrupt.
- **Reward-seeking**: The dopamine-driven pleasure of eating can persist as a desire even when physical hunger is reduced.

This is why the common experience on GLP-1s is: "I'm not hungry, but I still *want* to eat in the evenings."

## The Emotional Layer That GLP-1s Don't Touch

This is perhaps the most important insight for people on GLP-1 medications: **these drugs address physical hunger, not emotional hunger.** If your evening eating was primarily driven by emotions — stress, boredom, comfort-seeking — you'll likely find that the emotional driver remains even as physical hunger decreases.

For some people, this becomes more noticeable on GLP-1s, not less. When physical hunger isn't the explanation for eating, the emotional explanation becomes clearer.

This isn't a problem — it's an opportunity. GLP-1 medications, for many people, are actually a window into understanding the emotional patterns that were always there.

## What Actually Helps

**Build evening structure deliberately.** The medication may have removed the physical hunger that anchored your evenings. Replace it with intentional structure: a walk, a ritual, a specific activity.

**Address the emotional layer directly.** Use a tool like the Mindful Evenings check-in to identify what's actually driving the evening craving. Is it boredom? Stress decompression? Social eating? Address the actual need.

**Distinguish between hunger and desire.** On GLP-1s, you may find it easier to notice the difference: physical hunger has a specific quality, while the desire to eat in the evening may feel more like wanting an experience rather than needing fuel.

**Be compassionate about the adjustment.** Adjusting to life on GLP-1s — including changing eating patterns, addressing emotional eating, and building new routines — takes time. Expect a learning curve.
