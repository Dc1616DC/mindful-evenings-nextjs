This list isn't here to tell you not to eat. Sometimes a snack is exactly what you need and that's completely fine. But if you're looking for alternatives when you know the snacking is more about boredom, stress, or habit than hunger — here are 15 genuinely useful options, organized by what you might actually need.

**Important**: These aren't "distractions from food." They're actual needs-based responses. The idea is to identify what you're really looking for and address that directly.

## If You Need Stimulation or Engagement

1. **Start a project with a clear endpoint** — not "clean the house," but "organize this one drawer" or "reply to these three emails." The sense of completion is satisfying in a way scrolling never is.

2. **Play a game** — something with mild engagement like a puzzle game, word game, or even a board game if you have company.

3. **Read something genuinely interesting** — not Instagram, but a book, long article, or essay you've been meaning to get to.

4. **Learn something new** — YouTube tutorials, Duolingo, a skill you've meant to pick up. 20 minutes of genuine learning is surprisingly satisfying.

## If You Need to Decompress

5. **Take a shower or bath** — the warm water and sensory experience genuinely shifts your nervous system state.

6. **Do a gentle stretch routine** — even 10 minutes of stretching while watching TV reduces cortisol and physical tension.

7. **Step outside for 5 minutes** — even cold air, even briefly, changes your state. The circadian signal of outdoor air in the evening also helps with sleep.

8. **Breathe deliberately** — 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4 counts, hold 7, exhale 8) activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Three rounds is enough.

## If You Need Connection

9. **Text or call someone** — not to talk about the craving, just to connect. Even a funny meme is connection.

10. **Journal** — sometimes we need to process with someone, and when no one is available, a journal is the next best thing. Three minutes of stream-of-consciousness writing can release significant emotional pressure.

## If You Need Comfort or Rest

11. **Get under a weighted blanket** — sensory input that genuinely calms the nervous system.

12. **Put on comfort media** — a familiar show you've seen before, a comedy you love. You're not avoiding your feelings; you're giving your nervous system something safe and easy.

13. **Go to bed earlier** — radical idea, but if you're tired and it's evening, sleep might actually be what you need. Boredom and low-level tiredness look identical to many people.

## If You Need Something Oral

14. **Make herbal tea** — the ritual of making and holding a warm drink provides oral and sensory satisfaction. Chamomile and lemon balm have mild calming effects.

15. **Chew gum** — sounds silly, but the act of chewing activates calming jaw muscles. A few minutes of gum can reduce the urgency of a snack craving.

## The Bottom Line

None of these will work every time. And sometimes food is the right answer. But having a list ready — in a note on your phone, on the fridge, wherever — means you can consult it in the moment rather than trying to think of alternatives when a craving is active.
