Journaling about your eating patterns doesn't have to be a formal, time-consuming process. These 10 prompts are designed to take 5–10 minutes total — quick enough to actually use in the evening when cravings hit or after you've eaten.

The purpose isn't self-criticism. It's pattern recognition. You're becoming a scientist of your own experience.

## Before You Eat (1-3 minutes)

**Prompt 1:** "On a scale of 1-10, how physically hungry am I right now? What physical sensations am I noticing?"

**Prompt 2:** "What happened today that stands out? What was the most emotionally significant part of my day?"

**Prompt 3:** "What do I think this craving is about — and what does it actually need?"

## During or After Eating (2-3 minutes)

**Prompt 4:** "How did I feel before eating? How do I feel now? Did eating give me what I was looking for?"

**Prompt 5:** "What was I reaching for when I started eating — comfort, stimulation, avoidance, or something else?"

**Prompt 6:** "If I could give myself what I actually needed right now (not food), what would it be?"

## End-of-Day Reflection (3-5 minutes)

**Prompt 7:** "Looking at my eating today, what patterns do I notice? What was different about today compared to easier days?"

**Prompt 8:** "What did I feel proud of today? What felt hard? Did either of those things affect my eating?"

**Prompt 9:** "What need went unmet today that showed up at the dinner table or on the couch?"

**Prompt 10:** "What would I want to say to myself about tonight's eating? What does that inner voice sound like?"

## How to Use These

Pick 1-3 prompts per evening rather than all 10. Rotate them based on what's relevant. The goal is consistency over time, not exhaustive nightly reflection.

Keep a simple notebook by your couch or bed. Even 3 bullet points per night will reveal patterns over weeks that you'd never notice otherwise.
