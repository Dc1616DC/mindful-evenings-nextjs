HALT is one of the most practical tools in emotional eating work, originally developed in addiction recovery and adapted widely for emotional regulation and intuitive eating.

The premise is simple: before acting on an impulse — including a craving — ask yourself four questions:

**H** — Am I **Hungry**?
**A** — Am I **Angry** (or Anxious, Annoyed, or Overwhelmed)?
**L** — Am I **Lonely** (or Disconnected, Isolated, or Missing someone)?
**T** — Am I **Tired** (or Depleted, Exhausted, or Overstimulated)?

## Why It Works

Most emotional eating happens when one of these four states goes unaddressed. We feel lonely, but instead of reaching out, we reach for food. We're exhausted, but instead of resting, we use snacking as stimulation. We're anxious, but instead of addressing the source, we soothe with chips.

HALT gives a name to the state — and naming is the first step to choosing a different response.

## How to Use It

**In the moment**: When you notice a craving, pause for 30 seconds and mentally run through HALT. Which of the four resonates most? Rate each on a scale of 1-5 if helpful.

**As a daily habit**: Run through HALT before dinner each evening. This brief check-in can prevent the "eating-without-knowing-why" that characterizes mindless evening eating.

**After an episode**: If you've already eaten emotionally, use HALT retrospectively. What state were you in? This builds pattern recognition over time.

## What To Do With the Answer

HALT doesn't tell you not to eat. It helps you see clearly. Once you've identified the state:

- **Hungry**: Eat. Genuinely, enjoy it.
- **Angry**: What's the real issue? Can you address it, name it, or process it in another way before or instead of eating?
- **Lonely**: Can you reach out to someone, even via text? Sometimes naming the loneliness and sitting with it for a few minutes is enough.
- **Tired**: Can you rest? Sometimes a 20-minute nap changes everything. If not, can you give yourself permission to lower your standards for the evening?

## HALT as Part of the Mindful Evenings Check-In

The Mindful Evenings app incorporates HALT concepts into its check-in flow. When you pause with a craving, we help you identify not just what you're feeling, but what underlying need might be driving it — and offer pathways to address it with or without food.
