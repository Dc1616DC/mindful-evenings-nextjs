You've been on Ozempic (semaglutide) for a few weeks, and something weird is happening: you barely eat all day — not even hungry — and then around 8 or 9 PM, you're suddenly ravenous. The cravings hit hard, and you find yourself eating more at night than you were before starting the medication.

You're not imagining this. It's a real, documented pattern — and there are specific reasons it happens.

## Why GLP-1 Medications Suppress Daytime Appetite More Than Evening Appetite

GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic (semaglutide), Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound work by mimicking the hormone GLP-1, which:

- Slows gastric emptying (food leaves your stomach more slowly)
- Increases feelings of fullness
- Reduces appetite signals in the brain

However, these effects are not perfectly uniform throughout the day. Several factors contribute to the day/night imbalance:

**Medication timing**: Most people take weekly injectable GLP-1s (like Ozempic) without a specific time of day consideration. The medication is active 24/7, but its interaction with circadian rhythms may mean different effects at different times of day.

**Appetite circadian rhythms**: Your natural hunger hormones (ghrelin especially) follow circadian rhythms that tend to increase appetite in the evening for most people. GLP-1 suppression may be more effective earlier in the day when ghrelin is naturally lower.

**Meal pattern disruption**: When GLP-1 medications suppress daytime hunger, many people eat very little during the day. By evening, the body's energy deficit triggers compensatory hunger that can partially override the medication's suppression.

**Blood sugar fluctuations**: Minimal daytime eating can create blood sugar patterns that trigger stronger evening hunger responses.

## What to Do About It

**Don't skip meals during the day.** Even on GLP-1s, eating at regular intervals — even small amounts — prevents the energy deficit that drives intense evening hunger. Aim for something with protein and fat every 4-5 hours.

**Front-load your eating.** Research on chrono-nutrition shows that eating more calories earlier in the day generally improves metabolic health. With GLP-1s, this also means the medication is working when your hunger would naturally be highest.

**Plan a satisfying evening snack.** If evening hunger is predictable, plan for it. A protein-rich snack (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, a small portion of meat) at a set time reduces the "starving" feeling and prevents uncontrolled eating.

**Check the underlying need.** Evening eating on GLP-1s isn't always physical hunger. Sometimes the reduced daytime eating means the social and sensory pleasure of eating gets concentrated in the evening. Check in with yourself: is this physical? Or is it something else?

**Talk to your prescriber.** If the day/night pattern is severe or causing significant distress, this is worth discussing. Timing adjustments, dose considerations, or dietary structure can help.
